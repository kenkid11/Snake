## Project Title
Snake Arcade Game
## Project Description
For my project I would like to create a simple version of the classic arcade game Snake. I am very new to using python and coding in general so I wanted to choose a project that seemed familiar, doable, but also interesting. I remember that whenever I was bored and I had access to a computer I would open the game snake and see how far I could get. It was a great way to kill time. I am also a huge gamer and I have always wondered about the amazing coding work that goes on behind the scenes of a game. I think this project will really help me develop some great practical skills in python and coding that I will definitely be able to apply in my future career and elsewhere. I hope that by the end of this project I feel more fluent in using git and python and that I understand the workflow and environments that I will be working in. I am excited and looking forward to working on this project as it will help me understand the process that goes behind creating even such a simple game like Snake. I think it will help me appreciate video games even more.

# Snake

This is a simple version of the classic arcade game Snake, implemented using the PyGame framework. The aim of this project is to create a fun and interactive Snake game.

## Project Scope

### Game Version
- **One-player game:** The initial version of the game will be a single-player experience.

### Game Interface
- **GUI Game:** The game will utilize the PyGame framework to create a graphical user interface. This will allow for interactive gameplay with visual elements.

### Features
- **In Scope:**
  - Snake movement control using keyboard inputs.
  - Growing snake length upon consuming food.
  - Collision detection with walls and the snake's own body.
  - Score tracking.
  - Basic game loop with start and game-over screens.

- **Out of Scope:**
  - Two-player mode.
  - Complex AI for snake movement.
  - Online leaderboards.

### Game Architecture
- **Main Classes/Functions:**
  - `Game`: Manages the main game loop, event handling, and game states (start, playing, game over).
  - `Snake`: Represents the snake, handles movement, growth, and collision detection.
  - `Food`: Represents the food object, handles random placement on the game board.
  - `ScoreBoard`: Manages the display and updating of the score.

### Leaderboard
- **Leader Board:** The initial version will not include a leaderboard. This feature might be considered for future versions.

## Timeline
*To track progress on the project, we will use the following intermediate
milestones for your overall project. Each milestone will be marked with a tag in
the git repository, and we will check progress and provide feedback at key
milestones.*
| Date | Milestone
| Deliverables | Git tag |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-
-----------|
| **July&nbsp;15** | Submit project description
| README.md | proposal |
| **July&nbsp;17** | Update project scope/direction based on instructor/TA
feedback | README.md
| approved |
| **July&nbsp;22** | Basic project structure with empty functions/classes
(incomplete implementation), architecture diagram | Source code, comments, docs
| milestone1 |
| **August&nbsp;2** | More or less complete implementation. The goal is to have
something you can share with others. | Source code, unit tests
| milestone2 |
| **August&nbsp;9** | Complete implementation. Final touches (conclusion,
documentation, testing, etc.) | Source code, Conclusion
(README.md) | conclusion |
*The column Deliverables lists deliverable suggestions, but you can choose your
own, depending on the type of your project.*
## Requirements, Features and User Stories
*List the key requirements or features of your project. For each feature, provide a
user story or a simple scenario explaining how the feature will be used. You don't
have to get this section right the first time. Your understanding of the problem
and requirements will improve as you work on your project. It is okay (and
desirable) to come back to this section and revise it as you learn more about the
problem you are trying to solve. The first version of this section should reflect
your understanding of your problem at the beginning of the project.*
*Also list any required hardware, software, on online services you will need. In
specific cases, we might be able to lend you hardware or obtain online services.
Please email the instructor for more details.*
## Technical Specification
*Detail the main algorithms, libraries, and technologies you plan to use. Explain
your choice of technology and how it supports your project goals.*
## System or Software Architecture Diagram
*Include a block-based diagram illustrating the architecture of your software or
system. This should include major components, such as user interface elements,
back-end services, and data storage, and show how they interact. Tools like
Lucidchart, Draw.io, or even hand-drawn diagrams photographed and uploaded are
acceptable. The purpose of the diagram is to help us understand the architecture of
your solution. Diagram asthetics do not matter and will not be graded.*
## Development Methodology
*Describe the methodology you'll use to organize and progress your work.*
*First, describe your plan for developing your project. This might include how (or
if) you plan to use*
- *GitHub projects board to track progress on tasks and milestones*
- *GitHub issues to keep track of issues or problems*
- *Separate Git branches and/or GitHub pull requests for development*
- *GitHub actions for automated testing or deployment pipelines*
- *GitHub wiki for documentation and notes*
*Please also describe how (if) you plan test and evaluate your project's
functionality. Do you plan to test manually or automatically? Any specific testing
frameworks or libraries you plan to use?*
## Potential Challenges and Roadblocks
*Identify any potential challenges or roadblocks you anticipate facing during the
development of your project. For each challenge, propose strategies or solutions
you might use to overcome them, which may include getting help from the
TAs/instructor. This could include technical hurdles or learning new technologies.*
## Additional Resources
*Include any additional resources, tutorials, or documentation that will be helpful
for this project.*
## Conclusion and Future Work
*Wrap up your project description with any final thoughts, expectations, or goals
not covered in the sections above. Also briefly discuss potential future work,
i.e., what could be done next to improve the project.*
